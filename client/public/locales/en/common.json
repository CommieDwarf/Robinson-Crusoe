You\n          will also need a pile of wood that you can set on fire, hoping that some ship \n          passing on the horizon will notice you.",
      "objective": "To win, players must create the Fire item and build the wood pile \n          shown on the scenario card. If these conditions are met in the 10th, 11th, 12th\n          round, the players win.",

In one round, any amount of wood can be placed on\n          the pile, but no more than one building stage of the pile can be completed. (At\n          first, 1 wood token, then a maximum of 2 tokens, and so on.) Wood placed on the\n          pile cannot be taken back from it.",
